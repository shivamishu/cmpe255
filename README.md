# Assignment 1: 

Dataset: California Housing Price Dataset  
Downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices

Requirments:  

a) Pick a kaggle data set which might be fairly noisy.  

b) write a data cleaning and preprocessing  and visualization colab using any data set

c) you can do model training with scikit learn as well but we will not check the accuracy/performance of the model. the main focus is whether you did the right data cleaning


# Assignment 2:

Requirments:  
Colab to demonstrate various dimensionality reduction techniques (Image and Tabular Data):

i) PCA

ii) SVD

iii) LLE

iv) t-SNE

v) ISOMAP

vi) UMAP
